The thesis addresses trust management in the pharmaceutical supply chain, where multiple independent actors exchange data, certificates and other information sources. It proposes an architecture in which an on\-to\-lo\-gy, verifiable credentials and a smart contract on a blockchain jointly form a trust graph. The key element is a decentralized oracle network, where each oracle applies its own trust rules. Oracles consume heterogeneous data sources to compute a binary trust decision and a numerical trust score, and record these results in a smart contract on an Ethereum test network. The prototype is implemented using Docker containers and multiple oracles with different policies, and is evaluated on repeatable scenarios that show how trust scores change as input data deteriorate or improve. Finally, the thesis presents a STRIDE-based security analysis of the smart contract and oracle network and outlines the enhancements required for deployment in a production environment and for broader use in other domains.
